# So It's Shoujo

This at it's core is a quiz page, but adding in the links and the first page I wanted to give it a bit more. I really enjoy anime and manga, and was watching some video essays about them and thought I could making a web page with a quiz of one of the joke games the video did. 

I think that Shoujo does often get over looked or just talked about way more negatively than Shounen, but the site itself was just for fun. I was curious if I could and itching to do a react project from scratch with my own idea and this is what was made. Everyone should read and watch the anime/manga they enjoy but it's good to make sure you aren't putting a demographic into a tiny box of what it can be when it can be more.

So maybe give Shoujo or just anime and manga a try.

What was used:
- React
- React-Router
- React-type-animation
- Manga cover images found on google

- Deployment: https://so-its-shoujo.vercel.app

**Personal Highlights:**
This was first idea I started as kind of all my own so in general just getting it to the point where I want to show it even to my friends or husband si pretty cool. It also really proved to me that I can do the things if I take the time and effort, but it mostly proved that I really enjoy the process of coding and the work that goes into finding solutions.

**Struggles in the Process:**
This was the first time I used react-router so that was probably the biggest learning curve it was just a new setup to loo at and I had to dust off the media queries knowledge because it had been a little bit and I wasn't using a CSS framework so was figuring out the approach I wanted to change the responsiveness.
